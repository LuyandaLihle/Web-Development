        <h2> About MIET AFRICA </h2>

        <p>MIET AFRICA’s expertise in and innovative approaches to education 
            development have been gained through our experience of working within 
            the Southern African context since our beginnings in 1996.</p>
        <h2> 1993–95: Establishing our Roots</h2>
        <p> In 1993, the Independent Development Trust commissioned a research 
            initiative exploring the use of popular media— newspapers in particular—in 
            education with a focus on rural areas of what was to become KwaZulu-Natal (KZN).
            This brought together a journalist, Wilna Botha, and an educator, Lynn van der Elst, 
            who formed the Media in Education (MiE) Division of the Education Foundation. Over 
            the next three years, the MiE team explored ways of using print media in education,
            developing education supplements for popular newspapers and magazines, running workshops
            and developing educator guides.
            With the birth of a democratic South Africa in 1994, MiE’s role changed 
            to that of supporting the new democracy, resulting in MiE becoming an 
            independent trust.</p>

         <h3> 1996–99: Branching out on our Own </h3>

         <p> The Media in Education Trust (MiET) was formed in 1996, under the 
             direction of a strong Board of Trustees, and attracting funding 
             from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
             A University of KwaZulu-Natal training programme for using print media
             in education and a peace education training programme were developed,
             and an office was opened in Richards Bay. Thuli Dlamini, a research 
             specialist, joined the leadership, and who, along with Wilna Botha 
             and Lynn van der Elst, formed the nucleus of what was to become MIET AFRICA.

            MiET continued developing programmes and running workshops on the use
            of print media in education, but expanded its work in Africa through
            MiET Ghana, and opened five offices throughout South Africa. MiET began 
            moving beyond print media—developing training material and training 
            teachers in School TV, supporting government and the South African 
            Democratic Teacher’s Union in various national curriculum initiatives,
            forming relationships with key funding partners (including USAID and the
            Royal Netherlands Embassy [RNE]) and developing a model for distributing 
            education materials into rural schools in KZN</p>
         <img class="img-map" src="img/Page_2.JPG" alt="image" align="Center">

         <h4> 2000–04: Focussing on Rural Education development </h4>
         <p> MiET’s rural education development support comprised various strands:
             Help to communities to access and use resources <br>
            Materials development involving teachers <br>
            Training <br>
            Establishment of school clusters around nodal points <br>
            Development of HIV&AIDS material that would be integrated into the curriculum <br>
            Materials distribution<br>
            User support<br>

            A number of integrated projects such as the Zikhulise project and 
            the Multi-Media Rural Initiative (MMRI) pulled the strands together 
            and this  represented the initial elements of what was to be later 
            formalized into the Schools as Centres of Care and Support (SCCS) 
            and Education Centres models.
            The Zikhulise Project aimed to help teachers to develop their own 
            teaching and learning materials compatible with the new curriculum. 
            During implementation, the need for an effective rural distribution
            system prompted the development of the breakthrough RNE-funded Resources
            and Information Network (RAIN) Programme. RAIN distributed materials across
            rural KZN, using local contractors for secondary distribution from nodal points.
            At the same time, RNE funded MiET to implement the Multi-Media Rural Initiative 
            (MMRI), establishing multimedia rural education resource centres. </p>

          <h5> 2004–06: Taking Models to Scale </h5>
          <p> Throughout this period, MiET grew its reputation for developing 
              and successfully implementing innovative models, uniquely responsive
              to the context in which they were implemented. We also continued to 
              strengthen relationships with local and international funders, including
              the RNE, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and 
              Rockefeller Brothers’ Fund (RBF).
            MiET’s two core RNE-funded programmes were started in KZN and the 
            North West province—Education Centres Supporting Rural Development 
            and SCCS—while continuing to implement a number of concurrent projects 
            that added value to these core programmes.
            After successful implementation in South Africa, SDC encouraged MiET
            to investigate the feasibility of taking the SCCS programme into the
            SADC Region. MiET, in partnership with UNICEF and consultation with 
            the Ministries of Education, went on to implement the SCCS programme 
            in South Africa, Swaziland and Zambia.
            MiET continued scaling up models in South Africa, winning praise from 
            funders and government for the effectiveness of implementation, 
            especially for the SCCS model. The two and a half year pilot into SADC, 
            launched in 2005, proved a great success. MiET joined the SADC Secretariat
            as its implementing partner for the SCCS programme (renamed Care and Support
            for Teaching and Learning [CSTL]) throughout the region.</p>

            <h6> 2006–08: Expanding into the SADC Region</h6>
            <p> MiET continued scaling up models in South Africa, winning praise 
                from funders and government for effective and efficient implementation. 
                In particular, the two-and-ahalf-year SCCS pilot into SADC, launched 
                in 2005, proved a great success. MiET joined the
            SADC Secretariat as its implementing partner and in 2008, the SCCS
            model—renamed Care and Support for Teaching and Learning (CSTL)—was 
            officially adopted by the Ministers of Education as a SADC-wide programme.
            To reflect its growing involvement in SADC and Africa in general,
            MiET changed its logo from an apple to a leaf that holds a spiral as 
            a symbol of rural development, and changed its identity to MIET AFRICA.</p>

            <h7> 2009 to the present: Addressing Barriers to Learning & Development </h7>
            <p> MIET AFRICA has focussed on supporting the transformation of 
                education institutions in SADC Member States into inclusive 
                centres of learning, care and support, where every learner can 
                learn. Key to achieving this is the reduction of the impact of 
                societal, systemic, pedagogical and intrinsic barriers that impede 
                the achievement of the Education For All targets and Sustainable Development Goals. </p>

            <h8> 2009 to the present: Enhancing the Quality of Education <h7>
                <p> MIET AFRICA has worked with Ministries of Education to design
                    innovative approaches to support the strengthening of education
                    systems and institutions, including a strong focus on teacher
                    development, to ensure improved learner performance and education for all. </p>

                <h9> 2009 to the present: Empowering Youth </h8>
            <p> MIET AFRICA supports programmes targeting youth to improve access
                to youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health sevices and knowledge, 
                including HIV&AIDS, and to develop and deliver life skills, career 
                and entrepreneurial programmes. Through these strategies, MIET AFRICA 
                supports and empowers youth to take responsibility for their lives,
                achieve optimally, and participate fully in the political, economic and
